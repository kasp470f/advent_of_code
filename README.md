# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions
Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This is where I share my solutions to the yearly coding challenges from Advent of Code.

## 📌 About
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event that provides daily programming puzzles from December 1st to 25th. These challenges are great for improving problem-solving skills and learning new programming techniques.

## 🚀 Solutions
Each day's challenge consists of two parts, with increasing difficulty. My solutions are organized as follows:

```sql
📂 year/
 ├── README.md (optional notes)  
 ├── 📂 day_01/  
 │   ├── solution.py  
 │   ├── input.txt  
 ├── 📂 day_02/  
 │   ├── solution.py  
 │   ├── input.txt  
 ...
```
- Each folder contains a script (solution.py, solution.js, etc.) implementing my approach.
- input.txt contains the puzzle input.
